  Hi I'm Maow, I am a (mostly) independent developer. My primary languages are Kotlin, Java, and JS.
  I develop a lot of libraries, of which are always MIT-licensed, as I have a strong FOSS philosophy.
  I mainly just code for fun but a lot of my projects are designed to serve some purpose.
  Go ahead and check out my pins, those are some of my favorite projects I've made.
